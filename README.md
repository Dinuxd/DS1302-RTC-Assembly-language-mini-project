Objective of this mini project is to design and implement a real-time clock using DS1302 timekeeping chip, PIC16F877A microcontroller, MAX6952 display driver and four 5Ã—7Matrix LED displays. 
Functional clock had to be created to display system that accurately displays time and date information that obtained from the DS1302 chip.
DS1302 chip have comprehensive timekeeping capabilities. It can manage seconds, minutes, date, month, year and more. It has simple three-wire communication interface and therefore it is easier to integrate with PIC microcontroller.
In this project Proteus software was used and assembly language programming was used to communicate between PIC microcontroller, DS1302 and MAX6952 display driver.
